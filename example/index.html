  <h1> MathQuill Evaluate </h1>
  <h2> Evaluate MathQuill MathFields via the Wolfram|Alpha API </h2>
  <hr class="big"/>

  <p>
    MathQuill-Evaluate builds on MathQuill, and gives you basic
    capabilities for evaluating the expressions that users enter into your
    MathFields. Just pass your MathField as an argument to the evaluate function,
    and get a solution back.
  </p>
  <p>
    MathQuill-Evaluate does this by passing the LaTeX from your MathField to
    <a href="http://wolframalpha.com/">Wolfram|Alpha</a>. Wolfram|Alpha has the
    ability to evaluate arbitrary LaTeX and return either a simplified expression
    or a solution.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Wolfram|Alpha API is just <i>awful</i>, but I managed to make it cooperate
    a little bit. However, this isn't the stablest of projects right now. If you're
    trying to evaluate anything seriously, I'd recommend building your own, more
    robust solution, but this will work in many trivial cases.
  </p>
  <h1>Try it</h1>
  <hr />
  <p>
    This is a live example. This example displays LaTeX as you type, and then
    when you press "Evaluate", that LaTeX is sent to Wolfram|Alpha. After a few
    seconds, you should see a response.
